/// This macro avoids even reading from a queue, whenever this queue was the last one being handled.
/// This assures that even in the case of multiple handles on the same input in absense of a single
/// handle of the other, all elements are preserved in a sequential order.
/// 
/// This is only important for BinOps that must satisfy a trait with three different generics of the
/// form: I1: BinOp<I2, Output=O> as those trait bounds won't allow a bin operation on e.g. I1 + I1.
